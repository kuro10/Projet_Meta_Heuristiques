# Projet Meta Heuristiques

## About the project 

This program was a project assignement of the course Meta Heuristic at INSA Toulouse. The aim of this project is to famaliarize with mmeta heuristic methods to solve the a combinatorial optimization problem.

The precise problem was a evacuation plan in case of wildfire. "A good evacuation plan must not only minimize the evacuation time of all the population but also maximize the spatial and temporal safety between the evacuees and the actual or potential wildfire front". Read this [article] for more information.(https://homepages.laas.fr/huguet/drupal/sites/homepages.laas.fr.huguet/files/u78/paper-author-GeoSafe-Workshop-2018_0.pdf) 

In this project we just focus on minmizing the total evacuation time, also respecting all the capacity constraints and due date constraints with the given instances.
